# Memory Game Project

This is a project for the Front End Web Developer Udacity NanoDegree. The game is based on a set
of cards that will randomly be put in a deck facedown, once you click the first card a timer will
start to run and the game will track the number of moves you make, at the end of the game an screen
will come up telling you your punctuation(start based depending on a number of moves you've made),
a number of moves and the time that it took you, giving you the option to start a new game.
